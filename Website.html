                        Ourt papers show that the American politico tried to help 
                        Butina make inroads in Washington, suggesting names of people 
                        she should meet. The FBI said in an affidavit that Butina also 
                        sought to establish relationships with a "gun rights organization.
                        " The organization was not named but a senior U.S.
                         official confirmed <br>
                         it was the National Rifle Association, which did not respond to repeated
                         "Good morning! How are you faring there in the rays of the new fame?"
                          he wrote. "Are your admirers asking for your autographs yet? You have 
                          upstaged Anna Chapman. She poses with<br> toy pistols, while you are being 
                          published with real ones. There are a hell of a lot of rumors circulating
                           here about me too! Very funny!"
